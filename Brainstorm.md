Sure, here are some ideas for the core domain and concept for your chat application powered by GPT:

**Core Domain:**

1. Personalized Customer Service: The chat application can be used by businesses to provide personalized customer service via chat interface. Users can easily initiate a conversation with a customer service representative who is powered by a GPT model. The representative can answer user's queries, provide suggestions, address concerns and help them place orders.

2. Improved language skills: The chat application can also be used by individuals who want to improve their language skills by having natural conversations. Users can select a particular chatbot that speaks a specific language, or that is trained on a particular fit-for-purpose corpus to achieve their specific goals (e.g. conversing in a professional context, improving their informal language skills).

3. Virtual Therapy: The chat application can be used to offer therapy sessions in a virtual environment. The chatbot can be designed to act as a therapist, asking questions, being a sounding board, and providing guidance to users who may not feel comfortable seeking help from a human therapist.

**Concept:**

1. GPT Bot Personalities: To make the chat experience feel more natural, the application could offer users a choice of different GPT bot personalities. Each personality could have its own unique way of engaging with the user and could be trained on specific genres of text.

2. Multi-platform Integration: The chat application can be designed to integrate with popular messaging platforms, such as Slack, Messenger, and Whatsapp. This would allow users to start a conversation from any platform that they are comfortable with and be assured of a seamless experience across platforms.

3. Smart Responses & Reminders: The chat application could be designed to intelligently recognize keywords, dates, and times in conversations, and provide smart responses and reminders to users. This could be especially useful for businesses that want to send reminders for appointments, payments, and more.

4. Security: The chat application could be designed with security features to protect user data. This could be achieved by encrypting messages and using secure authentication mechanisms.

5. Analytics Dashboard: The chat application could offer an analytics dashboard, which provides insights into user behavior, the effectiveness of chatbots, and other metrics. The information could be used by businesses to optimize their chatbots and improve customer service.

These are just some brainstormed ideas for the core domain and concept of your chat application powered by GPT. You can use these ideas to craft a more specific concept that meets your intended goals.
